#include "RN487x_BLE.h"

#define bleSerial Serial1

void setup()
{
	rn487xBle.hwInit() ;
	bleSerial.begin(rn487xBle.getDefaultBaudRate()) ;
	rn487xBle.initBleStream(&bleSerial) ;
	if (rn487xBle.swInit())
	{
		rn487xBle.enterCommandMode() ;
		rn487xBle.stopAdvertising() ;
		rn487xBle.setAdvPower(3) ;
		rn487xBle.setSerializedName("Microchip") ;
		rn487xBle.clearAllServices() ;
